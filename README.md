# MAG-TOOL-HOLDER
*REMIXED* Hydra Fan Duct &amp; Tool Change System for Ender 3

Well it's been awhile but I wanted to share this remix, converting the standard hotend mounting to a more versatile setup...... magnetic holder for hotend. I never planned on making changes to all the files for the ender 3 setup.... but thats what happened in the end. Still the same design and construction, and still operates and mounts to the Ender 3 as the original.

Only changes small changes were made

Extended the bmg mount the extruder to the hotend as it is now 6-10mm in the +direction for the y axis.

Fan mounting moved to the hotend (with mount designed for microswiss or stock hotend.)

Tapered back the design around the hotend area, on both the rear and side duct mounting parts, to allow clearance for the mount

Redesigned fanduct egress end (the side the air comes out, (added angled extension to reposition duct ends to center on the nozzle as it was move......

Felt like a lot more work while making the changes.... guess not but still yes.. IDK I just know its done!!!
